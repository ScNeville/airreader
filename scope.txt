This app is to be mainly used on desktop(windows/macos) it is used to carry out desktop wifi surveys. it will take in a floor plan that allows the user to set the wall material and thickness, they will then be able to place a virtual access point (off different brands). this will generate a heat map of the wifi signal strength across the floor plan. the user can then move the access point around to see how it affects the signal strength in different areas. this will allow them to optimize the placement of their access points for better coverage and performance. They will be able to set how much speed is going to any of the access points and see how it affects the overall network performance. The app will also allow the user to simulate different scenarios such as adding more access points or changing the wall materials to see how it affects the signal strength and network performance. The app will also have a feature that allows the user to export the heat map and network performance data for further analysis. They can also add in virtual client devices to get an idea of the performance expectations. They will be able to toggle the different wifi frequencies to see how it affects the signal strength and performance.
